# Azure-RBAC
The script will enumerate and report Azure subscription RBAC definitions and assigned users.  By default, the script will not report on Roles with no users enrolled. This can be overwritten with the excludeEmptyroles parameter.  .\RBACReport.ps1 -ExcludeEmptyRoles $false     The report will be generated in the script execution directory. In order to run the script, the session it is execute from, must be logged in to Azure using login-azaccount or add-azaccount.  The script also supports comparing information from previous report data. This will give the ability to pickup up what has changed. Changes will be highlighted in Red  Note:Special thanks to Richard de Kock for assisting with testing and feedback.
